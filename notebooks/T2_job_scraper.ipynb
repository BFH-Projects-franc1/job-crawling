    "In **Timeslot 1**, I implemented a robust job scraping tool that:\n",
    "- Collected job listings from a job website,\n",

    "  - `url`\n",
    "  - `title`\n",
    "  - `publication_date`\n",
    "  - `workload`\n",
    "  - `contract_type`\n",
    "  - `salary`\n",
    "  - `languages`\n",
    "  - `place_of_work`\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Adapt the scraper (**Timeslot 1**) for DuckDB**\n",
    "   The existing scraping tool has been updated to optionally write output directly to DuckDB instead of MySQL.\n",
    "   In /src/data_saver.py the function \"save_to_sqlite()\" is updated to store the scraped data directly to DuckDB. The new function `save_to_duckdb()` replaces `save_to_sqlite()` and does not manually insert the `id`, as DuckDB can handle identifiers internally if needed.\n",
